# Mukul G — Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio!  
I’ve put together the work I’ve done across Electronics, HFSS simulations, Python, and Embedded Systems.  
These projects reflect what I genuinely enjoy building and the skills I’ve developed during my engineering journey.

## 📡 Microstrip Patch Antenna using HFSS (2.45 GHz)
I designed and simulated a rectangular patch antenna in HFSS for the 2.45 GHz ISM band.  
The project covers S11 tuning, gain improvement, radiation pattern analysis, and understanding how small design changes affect performance.

## 🎵 Mood-Based Melody Music System (Python)
A small but fun Python project where the program picks songs based on the user’s mood (happy, sad, or neutral).  
This helped me practice Python fundamentals and user interaction.

## 💡 4x4x4 LED Cube Light Controller (Embedded C)
This is a hardware project where I built an LED cube and wrote the C code to run different lighting patterns.  
I learned a lot about multiplexing and timing through this project.
